            <h3>A Stormy Weather</h3>
            <p>
                Magnetic Storm crashes all the building drones and freighters inside a very wide area of effect.
                As it's used on moving objects flying across the map real-time, it requires a lot of attention to use effectively.
                However, it has some niche usages.
                Let's say you saw three fully-loaded food trucks carrying 120 food flying across the Martian sky. No goon squads will save it from being crashed by a storm.
                If you saw your opponent building the key building you would not like to see, you can crash the building drone from reaching the site in the first place.
                Blow up their Offworld Market, wait for their repair drone to almost reach the site, and blow up the repair drone again.
                It can stop the building from functioning just like a power surge. Annoyed by Elite Pleasure Domes? Oh, they need to get the chemicals from somewhere...
            </p>
            <h3>Opportunity Cost</h3>
            <p>
                Magnetic Storms are fun to play with, but remember that you might want to use other items, too.
                I recommend you to have one in stock when you can't afford to buy other items,
                but it might be a better idea to buy a claim, get a goon squad, or power surge the competitor.
                Magnetic Storm is an opportunistic sabotage, not a solution for every situation.
            </p>
            <h3>Our Thoughts</h3>
            <p3>
                Some black market items are not as broadly useful as others, and therefore often forgotten. Magnetic Storm is one of them.
                We wanted to encourage players to explore usage of one exciting black market item: Magnetic Storm. 
                While our tournament did not cover other useful tools, like MULEs or Cook the Books, always take a look at what's in stock at the black market and use them accordingly.
                We hope that this award will shed some light on those underutilized black market items.
                <!--we want to see more creative usages, but we're also aware of its weaknesses-->
